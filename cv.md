# About Me:

I am 28 years old and I have been working in the field of public administration in the construction sector for more than five years.

My goal is to acquire all the necessary knowledge to become a front-end developer.  

**My strengths**: organized, responsible, sociable, gregarious

DESCRIPTION:
Make your strings more nerdy: Replace all 'a'/'A' with 4, 'e'/'E' with 3 and 'l' with 1 e.g. "Fundamentals" --> "Fund4m3nt41s"
JavaScript:
```
function nerdify(txt){
  let txtItem = "";
  let result = ""
  for (let i = 0; i < txt.length; i++){
       if ((txt[i] === "a") || (txt[i] === "A")) {
         txtItem = "4";
    }else if((txt[i] === "e") || (txt[i] === "E")){
         txtItem = "3";
    }else if(txt[i] === "l"){
         txtItem = "1";
    }else{
       txtItem = txt[i];
    }
  result = `${result}${txtItem}`;}
  return result;
}
